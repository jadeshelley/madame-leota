MADAME LEOTA PROJECT - CONVERSATION SUMMARY
============================================

LAST UPDATED: Current session
STATUS: Debugging black window issue - face animation working but not displaying

CURRENT ISSUE:
- The Madame Leota application is running successfully
- Face animation system (dlib) is working perfectly
- Audio processing and TTS are working
- BUT: The Pygame window shows only black - no face image is visible
- All logs show "successful" display updates, but nothing appears on screen

RECENT DEBUGGING STEPS:
1. Added detailed debug logging to display_manager.py
2. Added test pattern (red square) to verify basic drawing works
3. Added step-by-step logging in display_image() method
4. Committed and pushed changes to wav2lip-integration branch

CURRENT STATE:
- User needs to pull latest changes: git pull origin wav2lip-integration
- Then run: python main.py
- Look for red square in top-left corner of window
- Check for new debug logs starting with üé® CLEAR DEBUG: and üé® DISPLAY DEBUG:

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Face image processing: ‚úÖ Working (logs show successful cropping/scaling)
- Audio analysis: ‚úÖ Working (logs show amplitude/frequency analysis)
- Dlib animation: ‚úÖ Working (logs show successful face generation)
- Pygame display: ‚ùå Issue (window shows black despite "successful" logs)

KEY FILES MODIFIED:
- src/display_manager.py: Added debug logging and test pattern
- src/dlib_face_animator.py: Enhanced mouth animation system
- src/face_animator.py: Fixed dlib integration and base face loading

NEXT STEPS:
1. Pull latest changes from git
2. Run application and look for red test square
3. Check new debug logs to identify exact failure point
4. If red square appears: Issue is in face image processing
5. If red square doesn't appear: Issue is in basic Pygame drawing

BRANCH: wav2lip-integration
COMMIT: Latest includes display debug logging

PROJECT STRUCTURE:
- Main application: main.py
- Display management: src/display_manager.py
- Face animation: src/face_animator.py
- Dlib animation: src/dlib_face_animator.py
- Configuration: config.py
- Face assets: assets/faces/realistic_face.jpg

KNOWN WORKING COMPONENTS:
- ChatGPT integration
- Text-to-speech (Edge TTS)
- Audio playback
- Dlib facial landmark detection
- Face image loading and processing
- Audio analysis and phoneme classification
- Mouth animation algorithms

KNOWN ISSUES:
- Pygame window not displaying face images (primary issue)
- Window may appear behind other windows (secondary)

DEBUG COMMANDS:
git pull origin wav2lip-integration
python main.py

EXPECTED DEBUG OUTPUT:
- üé® CLEAR DEBUG: Clearing screen with color (50, 0, 100)
- üé® CLEAR DEBUG: Test pattern drawn - look for red square in top-left corner
- üé® DISPLAY DEBUG: Image shape: (614, 600, 3), dtype: uint8, position: (307, 300)
- üé® DISPLAY DEBUG: Surface created successfully, size: (600, 614)

If these logs don't appear, the user hasn't pulled the latest changes yet.
